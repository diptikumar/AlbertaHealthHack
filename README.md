# Project Description

#  is a platform designed to help individuals in rehabilitation learn new skills or continue their education, facilitating easier reintegration into society. The platform connects volunteers, who have an approved license from Alberta Children's Hospital, with children in need of lessons on how to ease their lives and gain skills despite their current conditions. Volunteers can provide skills training, educational insights, or emotional support. Parents can browse volunteer profiles, reach out to them, and arrange meetings or view recorded video sessions that volunteers post for interactive learning.
