# ConnectAbility

## AlbertaHealthHack

### Background
All children deserve to be part of society and integrate seamlessly after rehabilitation. ConnectAbility aims to connect experienced adults with youth in rehab to share their experiences, teach them new skills, and connect them to a community of like-minded people.

### How it Works
The website focuses on two demographics:

1. **Volunteer**
   - The volunteer is pre-screened and verified by the Alberta Children's Hospital, and they're able to create a volunteer profile for themselves.
   - They enter their email, name, and some information about their hobbies and interests.

2. **Parents**
   - Parents are able to search through a database of volunteers based on the disability their child has, and contact volunteers through email.

### Functions
1. **Daily Logs**
   - Allow parents to track what their child learned every day.

2. **Skill Tracking**
   - Track the new skills their child acquires and their progress over time.

With ConnectAbility, every child has the chance to learn the skills they want and integrate seamlessly into society when their rehab is over.
